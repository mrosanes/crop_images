crop_images is a program used to crop image stacks.
It aims to be a general SW that can be used in beamlines working with 2D image
stacks.
The input must be a stack of images in hdf5, and the output is stored in hdf5
format as well.

h5py > 1.8 has to be used in order to have availability of the function
copy from h5py; this function is used in the script when we like to 
replace an existing dataset by the cropped dataset in the same exact location
where the original exisiting dataset was placed.
